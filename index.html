<h1>Conversion Copywriter for Hire - Developer and Tech Tinkerer on the Side</h1>
<h2>i.e. arranger of words, numbers, and characters for maximum benefit</h2>

<p>Hey there!</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by. Let me tell you a little about what I do.</p>

<p><strong>I love writing copy.</strong></p>

<p>Messages weild boundless power. You live in a world constructed entirely by the meaning you and the people around you create, and all that meaning can only be channeled one way: language. If you want to sway real world events and create the outcomes you wish for the most, all you have to do is use <strong>the communicative circitry that's already hardwired into every human's brain on this planet</strong>: now <em>that's power</em>. And that power only gets stronger as the modern world rolls itself forward. <em>If the pen is mighter than the sword, then who's to say the keyboard isn't mightier than the atom bomb?</em></p>

<p>It might sounds a little creepy, but it's true.</p>

<h2>So let me rephrase here: I love building messages that <em>make things happen</em>.</h2>

<p>Clicks, opt-ins, purchases, comments - whatever the metric may be - I like to seeing needles jump and graphs turn into hockey sticks.</p>

<p>I'm guessing you like that kind of thing too. If you do, send me a message and we'll talk.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Wil</p>
