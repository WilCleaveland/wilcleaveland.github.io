<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>Based on traditional direct response principles, I aim for the copy I write to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be Tactful</strong> - The volume knob on your copy should have more than one knotch. Sometimes going over the top works great. But more often than not, a nuanced approach is key.</li>
<li><strong>Respect Audiences</strong> - I want prospects to know I've done everything in my power to grasp and acknowledge who they are, that I'm a trusted ally. 
<li><strong>Improve Lives</strong> - A tall order, I know. But great copy helps problem-solving products find their way into the hands of prospects who need them. And in that situation, I think everybody wins.</li>
</ol>

<h4>You're probably wondering why I didn't write "drive results," "skyrocket conversions," or something else like that up there.</h4>

<p>The reason why is this: I find results come naturally when I combine those three guidelines with the fundamentals of writing great copy.</p>

<p>Here are a few things my clients have said:</p>

"<strong>I'm super impressed with Wil's ability to deliver quality copy on time and on budget.</strong> He is easy to work with and gets things right the first time (e.g. doesn't require handholding or endless revisions)." 
<strong>- Drew Kossoff, CEO of <a href='http://rainmakeradventures.com/' target='_blank'>Rainmaker Ad Ventures</a></strong>

<p>"I've outsourced to other writers here and there, but Wil is my go-to guy when I need to outsource copy.</p>

<strong><p>He has excellent research skills. He's self-motivated. He hits deadlines. And he writes damn good copy.</p></strong>

<p>I can toss him an idea and let him run with it without ever worrying if we're on the same page. He knows how to take feedback. He asks the right questions. Overall, he just "gets it." </p>

<p>His abilities are quickly eclipsing "up-and-comer" status, and I strongly recommend you work with him. (In fact, I often send him referrals.)</p>

<p>Just please don't send him too much work... I'd like to keep working with Wil for a long time. ;-)"</p>
