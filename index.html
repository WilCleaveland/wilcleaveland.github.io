<h2 class="center">Direct Response Copy Support Founded In Proven Conversion Principles</h2>
<!-- <p>Converting apprehensive prospects into hungry buyers, apathetic bystanders into faithful brand advocates, and chronic skimmers into ravenous followers</p>-->

<h3>Got established traffic sources and systems for copy in place, but just need a competent direct response writer to help fill in the gaps?</h3>

<h3>I write sales letters, advertorials, emails, and lead generation content for people like you.</h3>

<p>You already know the impact copy makes on your business. I won't sell you on that. If you had the time, you could probably write homerun copy for your business all alone.</p>

<p>You don't have the time though. So you're faced with the daunting task of locking down a decent freelancer.</p>

<p>Wading through Facebook groups, sifting through dozens of posers and duds that apply to your ads, hearing them all do the typical song and dance to lure you into hiring them. And when you finally pick somebody it's still a crapshoot.</p>

<p>One thing's for sure though: when you find one that gets you, you hold onto that relationship as tight as you can.</p>

<p>More often than not, those kinds of arrangements come from personal referrals. That's been my experience, and I'm betting it's been yours too.</p>

<p>Well, while I can't give you that here, but I <em>can</em> give you a few words from the friends I've made:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I'm super impressed with Wil's ability to deliver quality copy on time and on budget.</strong> He is easy to work with, gets things right the first time (e.g. doesn't require handholding or endless revisions) and will surely be an asset to anyone seeking a competent and reliable copywriter. <br> - Drew Kossoff, <a href="http://rainmakeradventures.com/" target='_blank'> Rainmaker Ad Ventures</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Wil is one of the writers on the writing team I built and manage. He stands out because <strong>he's a fast learner and (unlike some writers I've worked with) he's dependable</strong>. As a result, I've already referred a few copywriting jobs to Wil. <br>- Ryan Healy, <a href="http://www.ryanhealy.com/" target='_blank'>Financial Copywriter</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Wil is a pleasure to work with. Writing for different industries is always a challenge, but he’s been able to quickly adapt to each client’s unique voice and industry jargon and always delivers great copy that requires minimal (if any) editing. <strong>I wouldn’t think twice about referring him or bringing him on-board for another project</strong>. <br>- Chris Dodds, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/doddschris" target='_blank'>Cloud Architect</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Clicks, opt-ins, purchases, comments, likes, shares - whatever the metric may be, I like to see needles jump and graphs turn into hockey sticks. And I like to do it with friends, not clients.</p>

<p>Every friendship starts with an introduction. Give me yours in the form below.</p>
