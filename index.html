<h1 class="home-head">Full-time Conversion Copywriter, Part-time Programming and Tech Enthusiast</h1>
<h3>Aiming to supplement measurable marketing fundamentals with a sensible IT skill set.</h3>

<p>I cut my marketing teeth over two years at a mom-and-pop inbound agency, dug a little deeper while interning for a federal IT contractor, then set out on my own to write sales copy full-time at the start of 2016 - all the while looking for opportunities to absorb more "hard skills" to give my work as much context as possible.</p>

<p>It didn't take long for me to realize I didn't want to be <em>just</em> a marketer or copywriter; the technical side of the house was keeping too much fun stuff all to themselves! Plus, I could never shake the feeling that I might be missing the big picture by not branching out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I couldnâ€™t possibly write the variety of books I manage to do out of the knowledge I had gained in school alone. I had to keep a program of self-education in process. <strong>My library of reference books grew and I found I had to sweat over them in my constant fear that I might misunderstand a point that to someone knowledgeable in the subject would be a ludicrously simple one.</strong> <br>- Isaac Asimov</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My head's not big enough to think I'm anywhere near as smart as Asimov, but I think that quote captures what I'm getting at: If there's knowledge out there to make your work better, why not go and learn it?</p>

<p><strong>Basically, I'm growing into an onion, layering marketing and tech skills on top of one another in hopes of becoming a versatile ingredient that fits in just about everywhere.</strong></p>

<p>Do you need an onion on your team? Give me a shout using the form below. Joining forces could be a recipe for success!</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>Wil</p>

<p>P.S. - I promise to keep the puns to a minimum.</p>
