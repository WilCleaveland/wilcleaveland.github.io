### Every piece of copy I write draws upon centuries old direct response principles. HOWEVER, I aim to integrate those principles without falling into the harsh, often gimmicky, and sometimes off-putting tone that gives direct marketing such a bad rap. If you're seeking that kind of voice - and I mean no offense - I'm probably not the best writer for your project.  

###That said, you can count on me weaving proven conversion principles into an appropriate tone for your business that makes your prospects feel valued, respected, and eager to buy.
