Every piece of copy I write draws upon time tested direct response principles - some projects steeped more strongly in classic direct response style than others, depending on the market, offer, audience, and location in the funnel hierarchy. 

However, I aim to integrate those principles without falling into the harsh, often gimmicky, and sometimes off-putting tone that gives direct marketing such a bad rap. If you're seeking that kind of voice - and I mean no offense - I'm probably not the best writer for your project.  

That said, you can count on me weaving proven conversion principles into an appropriate tone for your business that makes your prospects feel valued, respected, and eager to buy.
