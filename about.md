After spending a few years on the web working with digital agencies and business owners to make the most of their online marketing efforts, I decided to add a technical layer to my skill stack. 

Now I focus on freelance conversion copywriting and marketing consultancy while I pursue a second degree in Applied Computer Science at Roanoke College in Salem, VA.
